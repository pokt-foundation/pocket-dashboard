## Quick start

- First, make sure to run the DB script in the top level package.
- Spin up the `Dockerfile` script in the backend package.
- Install packages with `yarn` and launch the app with `yarn start` in each of the two packages. You'll have to provide your own values in the `env` for each, for which an example is included.

A detailed contributing and architecture guide is coming soon!

## Support & Contact

Follow these steps to help us prevent duplicate issues and unnecessary notifications going to the many people watching this repo:

- If the issue you found has been reported and is still open, and the details match your issue, give a "thumbs up" to the relevant posts in the issue thread to signal that you have the same issue. No further action is required on your part.
- If the issue you found has been reported and is still open, but the issue is missing some details, you can add a comment to the issue thread describing the additional details.
- If the issue you found has been reported but has been closed, you can comment on the closed issue thread and ask to have the issue reopened because you are still experiencing the issue. Alternatively, you can open a new issue, reference the closed issue by number or link, and state that you are still experiencing the issue. Provide any additional details in your post so we can better understand the issue and how to fix it.
